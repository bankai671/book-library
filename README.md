# Full-stack book library application

### To run server create .env file, look at .env.example

### To run server
```
cd library-server
npm i && npm audit fix
npm start
```

### To run client (dev only)
```
cd library-client
npm i && npm audit fix
npm run dev
```

### Client depends on server data, so if server is not running, you will only see loading spinner and header
